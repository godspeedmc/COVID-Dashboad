# COVID-Dashboad-with-React-

React.js is a declarative component-based JavaScript library for creating web-based user interfaces, while Chart.js is a JavaScript charting, or visualization, library. These frameworks can be used to develop applications that use APIs to connect with data sources. By combining the capabilities of these libraries and APIs, users can create engaging front-end web experiences. This guided project is ideal for developers with basic JavaScript and HTML/CSS experience who want to sharpen their front-end skills. In this hands-on guided project, you will use front-end JavaScript framework React.js to create a dynamic single-page application that visualizes data from COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group's API as a dashboard.

You will learn how to utilize and integrate front-end frameworks with APIs to build simple but powerful applications. By the end, you will understand the fundamentals of React and be able to create your own React application from scratch.  

To complete this project, you will be provided with a Cloud-based IDE from IBM that already has many libraries, such as React.js, preinstalled. Also, note that this platform works best with current versions of modern browsers.

*Apply and interpret JSX syntax 

*Describe and create a React Component 

*Utilize React hooks to store data and work with renders/re-renders 

*Use third-party libraries to streamline development
